## Required :
- For LINUX : `G++, SFML` 
- For MacOSX : `G++` (SFML files are included in the project)
- To update the documentation : `Doxygen, graphviz`

## How to use
Open a terminal.
- Compile using `Make`.
- Execute `./bin/exec 0` for SFML, `./bin/exec 1` for txt, `./bin/exec 2` for all the tests running
- Clean all the object files and executables with `Make clean`.
- To open the documentation on a navigator : `doc/html/index.html`
- To update the documentation use `Make docs`
### For SFML mode :
Use `Z Q S D` to move along all axis. Press `P` for Debug mode. Press `X` or `Escape` to quit.
